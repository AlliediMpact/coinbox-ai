# CoinBox Two-Factor Authentication Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your CoinBox account.

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. When enabled, you'll need to provide:
1. Something you know (your password)
2. Something you have (your phone)

This means that even if someone discovers your password, they still can't access your account without access to your phone.

## Why You Should Enable Two-Factor Authentication

- **Enhanced Security**: Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized account access
- **Protection Against Password Breaches**: Keeps your account secure even if your password is compromised
- **Peace of Mind**: Adds an additional verification step for sensitive transactions
- **Industry Standard**: Follows best practices for cryptocurrency and financial account security

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

### Prerequisites
- A verified CoinBox account
- A smartphone that can receive SMS messages
- A few minutes of your time

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Access Security Settings**
   - Log in to your CoinBox account
   - Go to Dashboard → Security → Two-Factor Authentication

2. **Start the Enrollment Process**
   - Click "Enable two-factor authentication"
   - You'll be presented with a setup screen

3. **Enter Your Phone Number**
   - Enter your mobile phone number, including country code
   - Optionally, provide a name for this device (e.g., "My iPhone")
   - Complete the security verification (reCAPTCHA)
   - Click "Send Code"

4. **Verify Your Phone Number**
   - You will receive a 6-digit verification code via SMS
   - Enter this code in the verification field
   - Click "Verify"

5. **Confirmation**
   - You'll see a confirmation message that 2FA is enabled
   - Your account is now protected with two-factor authentication!

## Signing In With Two-Factor Authentication

Once 2FA is enabled, your sign-in process will change slightly:

1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. You'll be prompted for a verification code
3. Check your phone for a text message with a 6-digit code
4. Enter this code to complete the sign-in process

## Managing Your Two-Factor Authentication

### Viewing Your 2FA Status
- Go to Dashboard → Security → Two-Factor Authentication
- Here you can see if 2FA is enabled and which phone number is registered

### Changing Your Phone Number
To change the phone number associated with your 2FA:
1. Go to Dashboard → Security → Two-Factor Authentication
2. Click "Remove" next to your current phone
3. Once removed, click "Enable two-factor authentication" to add a new phone

### Disabling Two-Factor Authentication

While not recommended, you can disable 2FA if needed:
1. Go to Dashboard → Security → Two-Factor Authentication
2. Click "Remove" next to your enrolled device
3. Confirm that you want to turn off this security feature

**Note**: Disabling 2FA will make your account significantly less secure. We strongly recommend keeping it enabled.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving the SMS Code?
1. Ensure your phone has signal and can receive SMS messages
2. Verify that the phone number was entered correctly
3. Wait a few minutes as SMS delivery can sometimes be delayed
4. Click "Resend Code" if available
5. Contact support if you still don't receive the code

### Lost Access to Your Phone?
If you've lost access to your phone and can't receive verification codes:
1. Use your backup recovery options (if previously set up)
2. Contact CoinBox support at support@coinbox.ai
3. Be prepared to verify your identity through alternate means

### Getting Locked Out
To prevent being locked out of your account:
- Keep your phone number updated
- Consider setting up backup recovery options
- Contact support immediately if you lose access to your phone
