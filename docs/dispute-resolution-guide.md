## Creating a Dispute

To create a new dispute:

Once submitted, your dispute will be assigned a unique ID and will enter the initial review phase.

## Understanding Dispute Statuses

Disputes progress through several statuses during the resolution process:

1. **Open**
   - Initial status when a dispute is first created
   - Under preliminary review by the system

2. **Evidence**
   - Both parties are invited to submit supporting evidence
   - Typically lasts 3-7 days depending on complexity

3. **Under Review**
   - Admin team is actively investigating the dispute
   - May involve verification of submitted evidence

4. **Arbitration**
   - For complex cases requiring detailed investigation
   - Handled by specialized arbitrators

5. **Resolved**
   - A final decision has been reached
   - Resolution details are provided to all parties

6. **Rejected**
   - Dispute was found to be invalid or fraudulent
   - Detailed explanation provided

Each status change triggers a notification to keep you informed of progress.

## Submitting Evidence

Supporting evidence is crucial for dispute resolution. To submit evidence:

1. Open your dispute case
2. Click the **Evidence** tab
3. Click **Submit Evidence**
4. Select the type of evidence:
   - Text: Written statements or explanations
   - Image: Screenshots, photos, or diagrams
   - Document: PDFs, contracts, or agreements
   - Video: Video evidence (limited to 100MB)
5. Provide a clear description of your evidence
6. Upload or enter your evidence
7. Click **Submit Evidence**

Best evidence types include:
- Transaction screenshots
- Communication records
- Delivery confirmations
- Product/service specifications
- Timestamps and verification data

Evidence can be submitted at any time until a dispute reaches the "Resolved" status.

## Communication During a Dispute

Clear communication facilitates faster resolution. The platform offers several ways to communicate:

1. **Comments Section**
   - Direct communication on the dispute page
   - Visible to all parties and administrators
   - Organized chronologically

2. **Private Admin Communication**
   - For sensitive information
   - Only visible to admin team and the submitting party
   - Toggle the "Private" option when adding comments

Best practices for communication:
- Remain factual and objective
- Avoid emotional or accusatory language
- Respond promptly to questions
- Reference specific evidence when making claims
- Be concise and clear

All communications are permanently recorded and may be used in the resolution process.

## Dispute Resolution Process

The resolution process typically follows these steps:

1. **Initial Review** (1-2 days)
   - System validates dispute is legitimate
   - Parties are notified of the dispute

2. **Evidence Collection** (3-7 days)
   - Both parties submit supporting evidence
   - System may request specific documentation

3. **Investigation** (2-5 days)
   - Admin team reviews all submitted materials
   - May request clarification from either party
   - Verifies technical details if necessary

4. **Determination**
   - Decision made based on platform policies and evidence
   - Resolution may be in favor of either party or a compromise

5. **Implementation**
   - Resolution actions are taken (refunds, reversals, etc.)
   - All parties are notified of the outcome
   - Case is documented and closed

High-priority disputes (high-value transactions or urgent matters) receive expedited handling.

## Appeals Process

If you disagree with the resolution:

1. Navigate to the resolved dispute
2. Click **Appeal Decision** within 14 days of resolution
3. Provide new evidence or reasoning for the appeal
4. Submit the appeal

Appeal conditions:
- New evidence must be presented that wasn't available before
- Clear explanation of why the initial decision should be reconsidered
- Appeals are reviewed by a different administrator than the original case
- Only one appeal per dispute is permitted
