# Allied iMpact Coin Box Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides details on the security enhancements implemented for the Allied iMpact Coin Box peer-to-peer financial platform. These security measures are designed to protect the platform from fraud, abuse, and unauthorized access.

## 1. Transaction Monitoring System

### Components
- **Transaction Monitoring Service**: Core service that analyzes transactions in real-time
- **Monitoring Rules**: Configurable rules that define suspicious patterns
- **Alert Management**: System for handling and resolving detected issues

### Detection Capabilities
The monitoring system can detect several types of suspicious patterns:

1. **Rapid Transactions**: Multiple transactions in a short time frame
   - Default threshold: 3+ transactions within 60 minutes
   - Severity: Medium

2. **Unusual Hours**: Transactions outside normal business hours
   - Default threshold: Transactions between 11PM - 5AM
   - Severity: Low

3. **High-Value Transactions**: Unusually large transactions
   - Default threshold: Transactions over R50,000
   - Severity: High

4. **Multiple Counterparties**: Rapid transactions with multiple different counterparties
   - Default threshold: 3+ different counterparties within 24 hours
   - Severity: Medium

5. **Escalating Amounts**: Pattern of increasing transaction amounts
   - Default detection: 3+ consecutive transactions with increasing amounts
   - Severity: Medium to High (depending on total amount)

### Alerting System
- **Real-time alerts**: High-severity alerts trigger immediate notifications
- **Admin dashboard**: All alerts are visible in the admin transaction monitoring interface
- **User notifications**: Critical security issues are communicated to affected users
- **Resolution tracking**: Full lifecycle management of security incidents

## 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting

### Trading-Specific Rate Limits
The platform implements specialized rate limiting for trading operations:

1. **Operation-specific limits**:
   - Create trade: 10 per hour
   - Match trade: 15 per hour
   - Confirm trade: 20 per hour

2. **Amount-based limits**:
   - Maximum R50,000 per hour in total trading volume

3. **Sliding window implementation**:
   - More accurate than fixed windows
   - Prevents boundary abuse (creating bursts at window boundaries)

### Rate Limit Enforcement
- **Gradual response**: Warning before hard blocking
- **Security event logging**: Rate limit violations are recorded
- **User feedback**: Clear explanations when limits are reached

## 3. Risk Assessment Integration

The new security measures are integrated with the existing risk assessment infrastructure:

- **User risk profiles**: Security measures adapt based on user history
- **Continuous assessment**: Risk scores update based on behavior patterns
- **Adaptive responses**: Actions vary based on user risk level

## 4. Testing & Monitoring

### Implemented Tests
- Unit tests for transaction monitoring logic
- Integration tests for rate limiting
- UI component tests for admin and user interfaces

### Monitoring
- All security events are logged for audit purposes
- Regular reviews of security patterns by the admin team

## 5. Configuration

Security thresholds can be adjusted through the admin interface or by modifying the default rule sets in the configuration. This allows the security team to fine-tune detection sensitivity based on operating conditions.
